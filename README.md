# AutoHotKey Scripts

## Scripts

AHK scripts organized into subfolders roughly according to their use-case.  

Profiles at the top level are only including other scripts as related groupings.  

> For example, the `HHKB2_Profile.ahk` includes all scripts I like to use with a Happy Hacking keyboard on Windows.
