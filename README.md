# AutoHotKey Scripts

## AHK Documentation

- [AHK Quick Reference](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/AutoHotkey.htm)

## Scripts

AHK scripts organized into subfolders based on the key types or intended use.

### Profiles

Profiles at the top level are only including other scripts as related groupings.  

> For example, the `HHKB2_Profile.ahk` includes all scripts I like to use with a Happy Hacking keyboard on Windows.

### Special Behaviors

Special behaviors will be indicated at the front of a script file name.  
e.g. `Tap` prefix for functions that only take affect when a key is tapped alone.
